# realtime-object-detection-and-tracking
This is a project for 02456 Deep Learning course at DTU.

We have successfully developed object detection with
both the YOLO V5 and FRCNN algorithms to find which one
would be more tailored for our needs. This comparison con-
cluded that the YOLO V5 is more suitable than the FRCNN
in terms of accuracy and speed.

In this repository you can found the trained models:
* Organized_code_FRCNN.ipynb shows the work procedure for the training for Faster R-CNN.
* The YOLO.ipynb contains model training for YOLO V5. 


## Usage

Please run these notebooks at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).


## Additional files

* The file additional.ipynb is an extention code and with some code of Organized_code_FRCNN.ipynb but with outputs
* The poster and report are included.
* Our final result is showed by a video where you are able to observe the performance of the project.
