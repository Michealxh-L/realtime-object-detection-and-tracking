This is a project of 02456 Deep Learning in DTU
The code is in serveral different ipynb file and maybe messy because different people responsible to different parts.
Specifically, there are Organized_Code.ipynb to show the roughly whole work procedures but some part of the implemention you need find in other files.
The additional.ipynb is an extention code and with some code of organized_code.ipynb but with outputs.
The utitled.ipynb contains model training for yolo. 

There is our poster. 
  
There  is a video to show the performance of this project.
