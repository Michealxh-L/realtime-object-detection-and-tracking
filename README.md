This is a project of 02456 Deep Learning in DTU
The code is in serveral different ipynb file and maybe messy because different people responsible to different parts.
Specifically, there are Organized_Code.ipynb to show the roughly whole work procedures but some part of the implemention you need find in other files.
The samulate code is a extention and with some code of organized_code.ipynb but with outputs.

  
There  is a video to show the performance of this project.
